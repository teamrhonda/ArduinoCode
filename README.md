2)	Download the Code: Rhonda_v4_onebutton.
3)	Documentations for each line of code is inside the code file.
4)	To change the rotation time, go down to the delay (number) line towards the end of the code and input in microseconds.
5)	Upload the Code to the Arduino Nano by:
  a.	Connecting the Arduino Nano to the computer using the USB connector
